# 1. How many breweries are present in each state? 

```{r}


# remove Washington DC for plotting in the map

brewery2$State <- factor(brewery2$State)

# Counts of breweries in each state
summary(brewery2$State)

# 2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file. 
```{r}
#merge brew id between tables
#rename beer brew_id column to Brew_ID
colnames(beer)[5] = "Brew_ID" 

beer_brew <- 
  left_join(brewery, beer, by = 'Brew_ID')

colnames(beer_brew)[5] = "Beer Name" # Change Column Name
head(beer_brew, 6)
tail(beer_brew, 6)
```

# 3. Address the missing values in each column
ABV and IBU have 62 and 1005 missing values out of 2410 respectively. 
Because for ABV’s missing value, it was only 2.6% of the dataset so we can ignore it. For the IBU, because it is right skewed; will use median to replace the missing value if its necessary. However, in this case, it’s more than 50% of missing values so we will not address it with median to avoid changing the model outcome.  

```{r}
# count the missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(beer_brew))

# ibu is right skewed, but almost half of the data are na values. This will be an issue.
hist(beer_brew$IBU)

# abv is normal with little skew, we are ok to use the mean to replace

# we will not be replacing the missing values since there are so few for abv
# we will not be replacing the missing values for IBU since there are so many
replace_abv = FALSE
hist(beer_brew$ABV)

if( replace_abv == TRUE )
{
  beer_brew$ABV[is.na(beer_brew$ABV)] <- with(beer_brew, ave(ABV, 
    FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)))[is.na(beer_brew$ABV)]
  sum(is.na(beer_brew$ABV))
  hist(beer_brew$ABV)
}
```

# 6. Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
Beer ABV's are slightly right skewed (probably since people like to have stronger beers) and mostly normally distributed. There is a peak around 0.05 which could be the maximum beer strength to sell in specific states' grocery stores. For reference: at least colorado, Utah, and Minnesota have laws that restrict the abv to less than 5% for grocery store sales.
```{r}
# find basic statistics on the abv column
summary(beer_brew$ABV)

# plot it in a histogram
ggplot(beer_brew, aes(x=ABV))+
  geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue")+ggtitle("ABV Histogram")
```

# 7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content?
Based on the scatterplot for the data that contain both IBU and ABV, it looks like there is a moderate positive linear relationship between the two variables. r2= 0.4493 
```{r}
# generate scatter plot between IBU and ABV
scatter <- ggplot(beer, aes(IBU, ABV))
scatter + 
  ggtitle("Alcohol content by volume vs International bitterness unit") +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "Red", se = F) + 
  labs(x = "International bitterness unit", y = "Alcohol content by volume") 

# create a linear model of the relationship and print a summary about it
beer.lm = lm(ABV ~ IBU, data=beer) 
summary(beer.lm)


```

# 8. Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually. 

K=26 
Sensitivity - 88.8% ability to correctly identify true positives (i.e. IPA’s that are IPA’s)
Specificity - 76.47% ability to correctly identify false negatives (i.e. beers that are not IPA’s)
Accuracy : 83.74%         
statistically significant 

```{r}
# find any styles that have " IPA" in them and save them to a new dataframe
ipa_beers <- grepl.sub(beer, " {0,1}\\({0,1}[iI][pP][aA]\\){0,1} {0,1}", c("Style"), keep.found = TRUE)
ipa_beers$Style = 'IPA'

# find any styles that have " ALE" in them and rename to ALE
ale_beers <- grepl.sub(beer, " {0,1}[aA][lL][eE] {0,1}", c("Style"), keep.found = TRUE)

# remove subset of beers that contain IPA in the style
ale_beers <- grepl.sub(ale_beers, " {0,1}\\({0,1}[iI][pP][aA]\\){0,1} {0,1}", c("Style"), keep.found = FALSE)
ale_beers$Style = 'ALE'

# 70% training data 30% test data
split_perc = 0.7

set.seed(6)

# combine the remaining ipa and ale beers to form the base dataset
knn_beers <- rbind(ipa_beers, ale_beers)

# select only the used columns
knn_beers <- knn_beers %>% select("ABV", "IBU", "Style")
knn_beers$IBU <- as.numeric(knn_beers$IBU)

# remove any NA values for IBU and ABV
knn_beers_dropmv <- knn_beers%>% drop_na(IBU,ABV)

# split the dataset into training and testing datasets 
trainIndices = sample(1:dim(knn_beers_dropmv)[1],round(split_perc * dim(knn_beers_dropmv)[1]))
train_beers = knn_beers_dropmv[trainIndices,]
test_beers = knn_beers_dropmv[-trainIndices,]

# typical k value should be sqrt of the number of samples in your dataset
k_value = ceiling(sqrt(length(train_beers$Style)))

#convert column to factor 
train_beers$Style <- as.factor(train_beers$Style)

# create scatterplot with labels for ales and ipas
knn_beers_dropmv %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU, ABV, color=Style)) +
  geom_point()+ggtitle("ABV vs IBU Classification")

# create knn model and evaluate the fit
classifications = knn(train_beers[,c(1,2)],test_beers[,c(1,2)],train_beers$Style, prob = TRUE, k = k_value)
class_table <- table(classifications,test_beers$Style)
confusionMatrix(class_table)
```

# 9. Scale breweries per state by proportion of population to overall US population then look at their least produced beers (ABV and IBU)

The states with the highest number of breweries per person include Texas and California; the result of this analysis is much different with the number of breweires in each state(qusetion 1). Which means in this case, we still can suggest customer to open a brewery in Colorado even though Colorado has the highest number of breweries, but per person is still lower than Texas and California. 
```{r}
# change the state values to lower case
us_pop$region <- tolower(us_pop$State)

# join the us population data with the brewery count data from before
brewery_pop <- left_join(breweryMapData2, us_pop, by="region")

# scale the beweries to match the proportion of the united states population
brewery_pop$Breweries_Scaled <- brewery_pop$Percent * brewery_pop$Breweries

# plot the scaled brewery counts
states <- map_data("state")
map.df <- merge(states,brewery_pop, by="region", all.x=T)
map.df <- map.df[order(map.df$order),]
ggplot(map.df, aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Breweries_Scaled))+
  geom_path()+ 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90")+ggtitle("Breweries Per Capita")+
